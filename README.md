Simple Python wrapper of the USGS/EROS Inventory Service Machine-to-Machine API as described in the [documents](https://m2m.cr.usgs.gov/api/docs/json/).

**The migration to the new API (v1.5.0) is complete as described in the Migration Guide (v1.4.1):** https://m2m.cr.usgs.gov/api/docs/json/#section-migration

**IMPORTANT**: You must have machine-to-machine access to execute queries. 
You can order access [here](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/profile/access). 

See usage example [here](https://github.com/MrChebur/usgs-machine-to-machine-API/blob/master/UsageExample.py).
